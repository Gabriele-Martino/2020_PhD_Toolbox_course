<center><h2><p>Questions and interaction</p></h2></center>

- We will use [Slack](https://phdtoolbox2020.slack.com/) for chatting, taking notes, and sharing URLs and bits of code.

- We will use **sticky notes** to assess the completion of the exercises or for asking questions. Sticky notes will be also used to evaluate each chunk of the course. This is a good way for the teachers to improve and help the students.
