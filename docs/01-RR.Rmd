.font170[.white[
**Replication** is the ultimate standard by which scientific claims are judged `r Cite(bib, author = "Peng")`. 
<br><br>
The fact that an analysis is reproducible does not guarantee the quality, correctness, or validity of the published results.

# What reproducible research is

```{r fulmine, echo=FALSE, out.width = "750px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/001.jpg")

# What reproducible research is

```{r miracle, echo=FALSE, out.width = "750px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/thenamiracleoccurs.jpg")
```

This is exactly how it seems when you try to figure out how authors got from a large and complex data set to a dense paper with lots of busy figures.
Without access to the data and the analysis code, a miracle occurred.

## Common practice of writing statistical reports:
.font150[
- We import a dataset into .red[Excel]
- Run a procedure to get all results
- .blue[Copy and paste] selected pieces into a typesetting program (usually .red[Word])
- Add a few descriptions
- Finish a report
]

# What reproducible research is

## There are obvious dangers and disadvantages in this process:
.font160[
1. It is .bold[error-prone] due to too much manual work;
2. It requires lots of human effort to do .bold[tedious jobs];
3. The workflow is barely recordable, therefore it is .bold[difficult to reproduce];
4. A .bold[tiny change] of the data source in the future will require the author(s) to go through the same procedure again;
5. The analysis and writing are separate, so close attention has to be paid to the .bold[synchronization of the two parts].
